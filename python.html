  <h1>Python</h1>
  <h5>Why Python?</h5>
  <p>Python is great for beginners because unlike close to the metal languages like C++ or Fortran 
    the programmer can run in in an interactive shell. That means you can easily experiment with commands 
    trying to find the correct command in the temporary shell, and then take that insight into your final 
    program.
  </p>
  <p>With C++ the process is slower. Due to the nature of C++ being compiled, you have to compile and wait 
    every time you want to modify your code. That can get tediuos at times. For that reason, if you learn C++ 
    as your first language, your exposure to the outside world will be delayed. C++ is great because it 
    forces the programmer to understand the low level complexities of the computer, but it lacks pratical 
    utility at the beginner level, so for that reason I say leave C++ on the shelf.
