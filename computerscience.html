    <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>
    <p>Let's say you were given a list of names, and you wanted to sort them into alphabetical order. 
      What would be the fastest most efficienct way to do that?
    </p>
    <p>You might want to iterate through the list N (the number of names) times picking out the minimum alphabetical 
      order name and the placing it at the bottow of a new list. Since finding out which is the minimum would necessitate 
      comparing every name to a possible minimum, that would be n * n comparisons.
    </p><p>
      We could do that with two for loops, one nested inside the other. We would say that has quadratic time complexity 
      because the amount of time it takes is the square of the number of entries.
      </p><h3>Here is an implementation:</h3>
      <pre>
v=['mary', 'elizabeth', 'winstead',"carol","karen"]
n=len(v)
for i in range(n):
  min = i
  for j in range(i+1,n):
    if v[j]&lt;v[min]:
      min=j
  t=v[i]
  v[i]=v[min]
  v[min]=t
      </pre>
      <p>
        But what if I were to tell you that there's actually a better way to sort? I didn't believe it 
        either. But it's true. It's called the Merge Sort Algorithm. It takes advantage of the perculiar 
        fact that it's easy to take two lists that are already in sorted order, and merge them into a single
        list. You just have two iterators for each list, and then you compare the i-th element to the j-th 
        element, and push the lower of the two onto a new list.
      </p>
      <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
      <pre>
def mergeSort(array):
    if len(array) > 1:

        #  r is the point where the array is divided into two subarrays
        r = len(array)//2
        L = array[:r]
        M = array[r:]

        # Sort the two halves
        mergeSort(L)
        mergeSort(M)

        i = j = k = 0

        # Until we reach either end of either L or M, pick larger among
        # elements L and M and place them in the correct position at A[p..r]
        while i &lt; len(L) and j &lt; len(M):
            if L[i] &lt; M[j]:
                array[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                array[k] = M[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        # When we run out of elements in either L or M,
        # pick up the remaining elements and put in A[p..r]
        while i &lt; len(L):
            array[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j &lt; len(M):
            array[k] = M[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1


# Print the array
def printList(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        print(array[i], end=" ")
    print()


# Driver program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    array = [6, 5, 12, 10, 9, 1]

    mergeSort(array)

    print("Sorted array is: ")
    printList(array)
      </pre>
      <p>Merge Sort has an improved time complexity of n * log(n) instead of n * n.</p>
      <p>Python of course has the best sorting algorithm baked into the language itself. The programmer 
        merely has to invoke the .sort() method function of lists to use Merge Sort.
      </p>
      <p>There are also containers (data structures) that keep elements sorted as they are added, in 
        a binary tree. Sets and Dictionaries use that technique.
